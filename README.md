# House Prices Prediction (Kaggle Competition) - Machine Learning Project

## Project Summary

### Introduction
This project focuses on participating in a Kaggle competition to predict house prices using machine learning models. The goal was to develop accurate models that could estimate the sales price of houses based on various features. The project showcases my expertise in data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of different machine learning algorithms.

### Key Steps

1. Data Exploration and Preparation:
   - Analyzed the dataset to understand its features and relationships between variables.
   - Handled missing values and performed data cleaning.
   - Utilized data visualization techniques to gain insights into the data distribution.

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Conducted feature engineering by transforming and creating new features based on domain knowledge and statistical analysis.
   - Imputed missing values using appropriate techniques to ensure a complete and clean dataset.

3. Model Development and Evaluation:
   - Implemented various machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), ensemble methods (Bagging and Boosting models, Random Forest), and Neural Networks.
   - Fine-tuned each model using hyperparameter optimization techniques, such as grid search and cross-validation.
   - Evaluated the models based on relevant metrics, with a primary focus on minimizing the R-Squared error.
   - Analyzed additional evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) for a comprehensive understanding of model performance.

4. Model Comparison and Selection:
   - Identified the best performing model based on its highest R-Squared score and consistent performance in terms of MSE and MAE.
   - Validated the selected model on unseen test data to confirm the accuracy of predictions.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling. By effectively utilizing various techniques, I successfully developed a robust model for house price prediction.
